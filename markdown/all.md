# Advanced Python Unit Testing
## A Comprehensive Deep Dive

### 1. Mock Objects and Patch Decorators
#### Understanding Advanced Mocking
- **Context Managers vs Decorators**
  ```python
  # Using context manager
  with patch('module.ClassName') as mock_class:
      instance = mock_class.return_value
      instance.method.return_value = 'mocked'
      
  # Using decorator
  @patch('module.ClassName')
  def test_function(self, mock_class):
      instance = mock_class.return_value
      instance.method.return_value = 'mocked'
  ```

- **Mock Side Effects**
  ```python
  def side_effect_func(arg):
      if arg < 0:
          raise ValueError("Negative value")
      return arg * 2

  mock_obj.method.side_effect = side_effect_func
  ```

### 2. Test Fixtures and Resource Management
#### Advanced Setup and Teardown
```python
class AdvancedTests(unittest.TestCase):
    @classmethod
    def setUpClass(cls):
        cls.shared_resource = expensive_setup()
        
    def setUp(self):
        self.temp_dir = create_temp_directory()
        self.addCleanup(self.cleanup_temp_dir)
        
    def cleanup_temp_dir(self):
        shutil.rmtree(self.temp_dir)
```

### 3. Parameterized Testing Techniques
#### Using Data Providers
```python
class TestWithParameters(unittest.TestCase):
    @parameterized.expand([
        ("valid_case", "input1", True),
        ("edge_case", "", False),
        ("error_case", None, False)
    ])
    def test_validation(self, name, input_value, expected):
        result = validate_input(input_value)
        self.assertEqual(result, expected)
```

### 4. Testing Asynchronous Code
#### Handling Async Operations
```python
class AsyncTests(unittest.TestCase):
    async def async_setup(self):
        self.client = await create_async_client()
        
    async def test_async_operation(self):
        await self.async_setup()
        result = await self.client.fetch_data()
        self.assertIsNotNone(result)
        
    def test_async_wrapper(self):
        asyncio.run(self.test_async_operation())
```

### 5. Custom Assertions and Test Helpers
#### Building Test Infrastructure
```python
class CustomAssertions(unittest.TestCase):
    def assertDictContainsSubset(self, expected, actual):
        """Assert that actual dict contains all items from expected dict"""
        for key, value in expected.items():
            self.assertIn(key, actual)
            self.assertEqual(actual[key], value)
            
    def assertValidResponse(self, response):
        """Custom assertion for API responses"""
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        self.assertIn('data', response.json())
```

### 6. Test Coverage and Quality Metrics
#### Advanced Coverage Techniques
```python
# Coverage configuration (.coveragerc)
[run]
branch = True
source = your_package

[report]
exclude_lines =
    pragma: no cover
    def __repr__
    raise NotImplementedError
```

### 7. Integration with CI/CD
#### GitHub Actions Example
```yaml
name: Python Tests
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.x'
      - name: Run Tests
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          python -m pytest --cov
```

### 8. Testing Design Patterns
#### Test Doubles Pattern
```python
class TestDouble:
    def __init__(self, test_case):
        self.test_case = test_case
        self.calls = []
        
    def record_call(self, *args, **kwargs):
        self.calls.append((args, kwargs))
        
    def verify_calls(self, expected_calls):
        self.test_case.assertEqual(
            self.calls,
            expected_calls
        )
```

### 9. Performance Testing
#### Timing Decorators
```python
def time_test(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end = time.time()
        print(f"{func.__name__} took {end - start:.2f} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper
```

### 10. Property-Based Testing
#### Using Hypothesis
```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st

class PropertyTests(unittest.TestCase):
    @given(st.lists(st.integers()))
    def test_sort_idempotent(self, lst):
        """Test that sorting twice gives same result as sorting once"""
        once = sorted(lst)
        twice = sorted(sorted(lst))
        self.assertEqual(once, twice)
```

### Best Practices Summary
1. **Test Organization**
   - Group related tests
   - Use descriptive names
   - Maintain test independence

2. **Performance Considerations**
   - Mock expensive operations
   - Use appropriate fixtures
   - Consider test parallelization

# Mastering Unit Testing in Python with unittest

## Slide 1: Title Slide
**Title:** Mastering Unit Testing in Python with unittest  
**Subtitle:** Write Robust and Reliable Code

*Speaker Notes:*
> Welcome, everyone! Today, we're going to dive deep into unit testing in Python using the built-in unittest framework. By the end of this presentation, you'll have a solid understanding of how to write effective tests, organize your test suites, and use mocking to isolate your code.

## Slide 2: What is Unit Testing?
* Testing individual units of code (functions, methods) in isolation
* Focuses on verifying the smallest testable parts of an application
* Like testing individual gears in a machine, not the whole machine at once

*Speaker Notes:*
> Unit testing is all about breaking down your code into its smallest components and testing each one independently. Think of it like quality control for individual parts before assembling a larger product.
> 
> We're isolating these units to make sure they behave exactly as we expect.

## Slide 3: Why Unit Testing? (Benefits)
* **Reduces Defects:** Find bugs early, saving time and money
* **Improves Code Quality:** Forces better design and modularity
* **Facilitates Refactoring:** Provides a safety net for code changes
* **Living Documentation:** Tests show how code should work
* **Increased Confidence:** Make changes without fear of breaking things

*Speaker Notes:*
> Unit testing isn't just extra work; it's an investment that pays off significantly.
> 
> Early bug detection is crucial. Fixing a bug in production is much more expensive than fixing it during development.
> 
> Tests act as a safety net, allowing you to refactor and improve your code without worrying about introducing regressions.
> 
> Well-written tests are like living documentation, providing clear examples of how your code is supposed to be used.

## Slide 4: The Testing Pyramid
* Base (Largest): Unit Tests
* Middle: Integration Tests
* Top (Smallest): End-to-End (E2E) Tests

**Key Points:**
* Unit tests should form the foundation of your testing strategy
* Integration tests check how units work together
* E2E tests validate the entire application flow

*Speaker Notes:*
> The testing pyramid illustrates the ideal distribution of tests.
> 
> Unit tests are fast, cheap, and easy to write, so we should have a lot of them.
> 
> E2E tests are slow, brittle, and expensive, so we should have fewer of them.
> 
> Integration tests fall somewhere in between.

## Slide 5: FIRST Principles of Good Unit Tests
* **Fast:** Run quickly
* **Isolated:** Independent of each other
* **Repeatable:** Same result every time
* **Self-validating:** Clear pass/fail
* **Timely:** Written before/alongside code (TDD)

*Speaker Notes:*
> These principles are guidelines for writing effective unit tests.
> 
> Fast tests encourage frequent execution, leading to faster feedback.
> 
> Isolation ensures that tests don't interfere with each other.
> 
> Repeatability is essential for reliable results.
> 
> Self-validation means we don't need to manually inspect the results.
> 
> Timely test writing promotes better code design.

## Slide 6: Introducing unittest
* Python's built-in testing framework
* Inspired by JUnit (Java)
* Provides tools for:
  * Creating test cases (unittest.TestCase)
  * Making assertions (e.g., assertEqual)
  * Running tests (test runners)

*Speaker Notes:*
> unittest is readily available; you don't need to install anything extra.
> 
> It's a powerful and versatile framework for writing all kinds of unit tests.

## Slide 7: Your First Unit Test
```python
# my_module.py
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

# test_my_module.py
import unittest
from my_module import add

class TestAdd(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_add(self):
        self.assertEqual(add(2, 3), 5)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

*Speaker Notes:*
> Here's a simple example of a function and its corresponding test.
> 
> We create a class that inherits from unittest.TestCase.
> 
> Test methods start with test_.
> 
> We use self.assertEqual to check the expected result.
> 
> unittest.main() runs the tests.

## Slide 8: Running Tests
**From the Command Line:**
```bash
python -m unittest test_my_module.py
python -m unittest discover
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p '*_test.py'
python -m unittest -v test_my_module.py
```

**From within File:**
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

*Speaker Notes:*
> You can run tests from the command line or directly within your test file.
> 
> The discover option automatically finds tests.
> 
> Verbose mode (-v) provides more detailed output.
> 
> Explain the meaning of ., F, E, and s in the test output.

## Slide 9: Assertion Methods
Common assertions with examples:
```python
self.assertEqual(a, b)      # Checks a == b
self.assertTrue(x)          # Checks bool(x) is True
self.assertIsNone(x)        # Checks x is None
self.assertIn(a, b)         # Checks a in b
self.assertRaises(Exception, callable, *args, **kwargs)  # Checks for exceptions
```

*Speaker Notes:*
> Assertions are the heart of your tests; they verify the expected behavior.
> 
> Use the most specific assertion possible for better readability and error messages.
> 
> Especially emphasize assertRaises for testing error handling.

## Slide 10: assertRaises Example
```python
import unittest

def divide(x, y):
    if y == 0:
        raise ZeroDivisionError("Cannot divide by zero")
    return x / y

class TestDivide(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_divide_by_zero(self):
        with self.assertRaises(ZeroDivisionError):
            divide(10, 0)
```

*Speaker Notes:*
> It's crucial to test how your code handles errors.
> 
> The with self.assertRaises(...) context manager ensures the exception is caught.
> 
> If the expected exception is not raised, the test will fail.

## Slide 11: Setup and Teardown
* `setUp()`: Runs before each test method
* `tearDown()`: Runs after each test method (even if it fails)
* `setUpClass()`: Runs once before all tests in a class (@classmethod)
* `tearDownClass()`: Runs once after all tests in a class (@classmethod)

*Speaker Notes:*
> Setup and teardown methods ensure that each test starts in a consistent and clean state.
> 
> This prevents tests from interfering with each other.
> 
> tearDown is crucial for cleaning up resources, even if a test fails.

## Slide 12: Setup and Teardown Example
```python
import unittest
import tempfile
import os

class TestFileOps(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.temp_file = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False)
        self.file_path = self.temp_file.name

    def tearDown(self):
        self.temp_file.close()
        os.remove(self.file_path)

    def test_write_to_file(self):
        # ... (test logic) ...
```

*Speaker Notes:*
> This example shows how to create and delete a temporary file for each test.
> 
> The setUp method creates the file, and tearDown cleans it up.

## Slide 13: Organizing Tests
* Separate Test Files: Keep tests separate from production code
* Mirror Directory Structure: Organize test files similarly to your source code
* Descriptive Names: Use clear names for files, classes, and methods
* Test Suites: Group related tests together
* `__init__.py`: Include in test directories to make them packages

*Speaker Notes:*
> Good organization is essential for maintainability, especially as your project grows.
> 
> Mirroring the directory structure makes it easy to find the tests for a specific module.
> 
> Test suites can help you run specific groups of tests.

## Slide 14: Mocking - Isolating Dependencies
**Problem:** Testing code with external dependencies (network, database, etc.)
**Solution:** Replace dependencies with "test doubles" (mocks, stubs)

**Benefits:**
* Faster tests
* More reliable tests (no external dependencies)
* Control over dependency behavior

*Speaker Notes:*
> Mocking is a powerful technique for isolating your units of code.
> 
> We replace real dependencies with controlled objects, allowing us to focus on the logic of the unit we're testing.

## Slide 15: unittest.mock
* Built-in library for creating mocks and stubs
* Key classes:
  * `Mock`: The basic mock object
  * `MagicMock`: Handles magic methods automatically
  * `patch`: Decorator/context manager for replacing objects

*Speaker Notes:*
> unittest.mock provides everything you need to create sophisticated mocks.
> 
> patch is a very convenient way to replace real objects with mocks.

## Slide 16: Mocking Example (Part 1)
```python
# my_module.py
import requests

def get_data_from_api(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    response.raise_for_status()
    return response.json()
```

*Speaker Notes:*
> This function fetches data from an API. We want to test it without making actual network requests.

## Slide 17: Mocking Example (Part 2)
```python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch
from my_module import get_data_from_api

class TestGetData(unittest.TestCase):
    @patch('my_module.requests.get')
    def test_success(self, mock_get):
        mock_response = Mock()
        mock_response.json.return_value = {'data': 'Mocked'}
        mock_response.status_code = 200
        mock_get.return_value = mock_response
        
        data = get_data_from_api('https://example.com')
        
        mock_get.assert_called_once_with('https://example.com')
        self.assertEqual(data, {'data': 'Mocked'})
```

*Speaker Notes:*
> We use @patch to replace requests.get with a mock.
> 
> We configure the mock to return a specific response.
> 
> We call the function and make assertions.
> 
> We verify that the mock was called with the correct arguments.

## Slide 18: Mocking Example - Handling Exceptions
```python
@patch('my_module.requests.get')
def test_failure(self, mock_get):
    mock_get.side_effect = requests.exceptions.RequestException()
    with self.assertRaises(requests.exceptions.RequestException):
        get_data_from_api('https://example.com')
```

*Speaker Notes:*
> We can also use side_effect to make the mock raise an exception.
> 
> This allows us to test how our code handles errors from the API.

## Slide 19: patch as a Context Manager
```python
class TestGetDataFromApi(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_get_data_from_api_success_context_manager(self):
        with patch('my_module.requests.get') as mock_get:
            mock_response = Mock()
            mock_response.json.return_value = {'data': 'Mocked data'}
            mock_response.status_code = 200
            mock_get.return_value = mock_response

            data = get_data_from_api('https://example.com/api')

            mock_get.assert_called_once_with('https://example.com/api')
            self.assertEqual(data, {'data': 'Mocked data'})
            mock_response.raise_for_status.assert_not_called()
```

*Speaker Notes:*
> You can also use patch as a context manager, which can be cleaner for simple mocks.
> 
> The patching is automatically undone when the with block ends.

## Slide 20: Test-Driven Development (TDD)
**Red-Green-Refactor:**
1. Red: Write a failing test first
2. Green: Write the minimum code to pass the test
3. Refactor: Clean up and improve the code

**Benefits:**
* 100% test coverage (in theory)
* Better code design
* Immediate feedback

*Speaker Notes:*
> TDD is a powerful development methodology where you write the tests before the code.
> 
> This forces you to think about the requirements and design before implementation.

## Slide 21: Parametrized Tests with subTest
```python
class TestDiscount(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_calculate_discount(self):
        test_cases = [(100, 0, 100), (100, 50, 50)]
        for price, discount, expected in test_cases:
            with self.subTest(price=price, discount=discount):
                self.assertEqual(calculate_discount(price, discount), expected)
```

*Speaker Notes:*
> subTest allows for running multiple test cases efficiently.
> 
> If one sub-test fails, the others continue to run, and you'll get detailed output.

## Slide 22: Skipping Tests
* `@unittest.skip(reason)`: Skip unconditionally
* `@unittest.skipIf(condition, reason)`: Skip if condition is true
* `@unittest.skipUnless(condition, reason)`: Skip unless condition is true

*Speaker Notes:*
> Sometimes you need to temporarily disable tests (e.g., for platform-specific features or known bugs).

## Slide 23: Advanced Topics
* Expected Failures: `@unittest.expectedFailure`
* Code Coverage: Tools like coverage.py
* Continuous Integration (CI): Automate test execution
* Fixtures (brief mention, suggest pytest for more advanced fixture management)

*Speaker Notes:*
> Briefly introduce some more advanced topics to give audience an idea of the next steps.

## Slide 24: Key Takeaways
* Unit testing is crucial for writing robust and reliable code
* unittest is Python's built-in, powerful testing framework
* Use assertions to verify expected behavior
* Organize your tests for maintainability
* Mock dependencies to isolate your code
* Practice TDD for better design and coverage

# Mastering Unit Testing in Python with `unittest`

**Target Audience:** Python developers with some programming experience who want to improve code quality and reliability through testing.

**Course Objectives:**

*   Understand the fundamental principles of unit testing.
*   Write effective unit tests using the `unittest` framework.
*   Organize test suites and manage test execution.
*   Handle setup and teardown operations within tests.
*   Use assertions to verify expected outcomes.
*   Understand and implement test doubles (mocks and stubs).
*   Integrate testing into a development workflow.

**Course Outline:**

## Module 1: Introduction to Unit Testing

*   **What is Unit Testing?**
    *   Definition:  Testing individual units (usually functions or methods) of code in isolation.
    *   Purpose:
        *   Early bug detection.
        *   Facilitates refactoring (changing code without changing functionality).
        *   Acts as documentation (tests show how code *should* work).
        *   Improved code design (testable code tends to be modular and well-structured).
        *   Increased confidence in code changes.
    *   Example: Imagine a simple calculator.  A unit test for the `add` function would check that `add(2, 3)` returns 5.  We're not testing the entire calculator, just that one specific function.

*   **Why Unit Testing is Important (The Benefits)**
    *   **Reduces Defects:** Catching errors early saves time and money compared to finding them later in the development cycle (or worse, in production).
    *   **Improves Code Quality:** The act of writing tests forces you to think about the design of your code.  If a function is difficult to test, it's often a sign that it's doing too much and should be broken down.
    *   **Facilitates Regression Testing:** When you make changes to your code, your unit tests act as a safety net.  They ensure that existing functionality hasn't been broken by the new code (regression).
    *   **Living Documentation:** Well-written tests clearly demonstrate how a function or class is intended to be used.  They provide concrete examples.

*   **The Testing Pyramid**
    *   Concept:  A visual representation of the ideal distribution of tests.  Unit tests form the broad base (most numerous), followed by integration tests (testing how units work together), and a smaller number of end-to-end (E2E) tests (testing the entire application).
    *   Explanation:  Unit tests are fast and cheap to run, so you should have many of them.  E2E tests are slow and brittle, so you should have fewer.  Integration tests are in the middle.
    *    Analogy: Like building a house, a strong foundation (unit tests) is crucial.

*   **FIRST Principles of Good Unit Tests**
    *   **F**ast: Tests should run quickly.  Slow tests discourage frequent running.
    *   **I**solated:  Tests should not depend on or affect each other.  The outcome of one test should not influence another.
    *   **R**epeatable:  Running the same test multiple times should always produce the same result, regardless of the environment.
    *   **S**elf-validating: Tests should clearly indicate success or failure (pass/fail) without manual inspection.
    *   **T**imely: Tests should be written *before* or alongside the code they are testing (Test-Driven Development, TDD).

## Module 2: Getting Started with `unittest`

*   **The `unittest` Framework**
    *   Introduction: Python's built-in testing framework, inspired by JUnit (from Java).
    *   Key Components:
        *   `unittest.TestCase`:  The base class for creating test cases.
        *   Assertion Methods:  Methods like `assertEqual`, `assertTrue`, `assertRaises` to check expected outcomes.
        *   Test Runners: Tools to discover and execute tests (e.g., `unittest.main()`, command-line tools).

*   **Your First Unit Test**

    ```python
    # my_module.py (The code to be tested)
    def add(x, y):
        """Adds two numbers."""
        return x + y

    def subtract(x, y):
        """Subtracts two numbers."""
        return x - y

    # test_my_module.py (The test file)
    import unittest
    from my_module import add, subtract  # Import the functions to test

    class TestMyModule(unittest.TestCase):  # Inherit from unittest.TestCase

        def test_add(self):
            """Test the add function."""
            self.assertEqual(add(2, 3), 5)  # Assertion: check equality
            self.assertEqual(add(-1, 1), 0)
            self.assertEqual(add(-1, -1), -2)

        def test_subtract(self):
            """Test the subtract function."""
            self.assertEqual(subtract(5, 2), 3)
            self.assertEqual(subtract(1, -1), 2)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        unittest.main()  # Run the tests
    ```

    *   **Explanation:**
        *   We import `unittest` and the functions we want to test.
        *   We create a class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`.
        *   Each test is a method within this class, starting with the prefix `test_`.
        *   We use `self.assertEqual()` to check if the result of the function call is equal to the expected value.
        *   `unittest.main()` discovers and runs all the test methods in the class.

*   **Running Tests**
    *   **From the Command Line:**
        *   `python -m unittest test_my_module.py` (Runs tests in the specified file)
        *   `python -m unittest discover` (Discovers and runs tests in the current directory and subdirectories)
        *   `python -m unittest discover -s tests` (Specifies a directory named "tests" to search)
        *   `python -m unittest -v test_my_module.py` (Verbose mode - more output)
    *   **From within the file**
        * `if __name__ == "__main__": unittest.main()`

    *   **Interpreting Test Results:**
        *   `.` (period):  Test passed.
        *   `F`:  Test failed (an assertion failed).
        *   `E`:  Error occurred (exception raised outside of an assertion).
        *   `s`: Test was skipped

## Module 3:  Assertion Methods

*   **Commonly Used Assertions**

    ```python
    import unittest

    class TestAssertions(unittest.TestCase):

        def test_equal(self):
            self.assertEqual(2 + 2, 4)  # Checks if two values are equal
            self.assertNotEqual(2 + 2, 5) # Checks if two values are not equal

        def test_true_false(self):
            self.assertTrue(True)  # Checks if a value is True
            self.assertFalse(False) # Checks if a value is False

        def test_is_none(self):
            self.assertIsNone(None) # Checks if a value is None
            self.assertIsNotNone(1)  # Checks if a value is not None.

        def test_in(self):
            self.assertIn(1, [1, 2, 3])  # Checks if an item is in a sequence
            self.assertNotIn(4, [1, 2, 3]) # Checks if an item is not in a sequence.

        def test_instance_of(self):
            self.assertIsInstance("hello", str)  # Checks if an object is an instance of a class
            self.assertNotIsInstance(5, str)  # Checks the opposite of the above

        def test_raises(self):
            with self.assertRaises(ValueError):  # Checks if a specific exception is raised
                raise ValueError("This is a test exception")

            with self.assertRaises(TypeError):
                int("a")

            with self.assertRaisesRegex(ValueError, "invalid literal"):
                int("abc") # Check if exception message matches regular expresion

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        unittest.main()

    ```
    * **Explanation:**
        *  `assertEqual(a, b)`: Checks if `a == b`.
        *  `assertNotEqual(a, b)`: Checks if `a != b`.
        *  `assertTrue(x)`: Checks if `bool(x)` is True.
        *  `assertFalse(x)`: Checks if `bool(x)` is False.
        *  `assertIs(a, b)`: Checks if `a is b` (same object in memory).
        *  `assertIsNot(a, b)`: Checks if `a is not b`.
        *  `assertIsNone(x)`: Checks if `x is None`.
        *  `assertIsNotNone(x)`: Checks if `x is not None`.
        *  `assertIn(a, b)`: Checks if `a in b` (for lists, tuples, sets, etc.).
        *  `assertNotIn(a, b)`: Checks if `a not in b`.
        *  `assertIsInstance(a, b)`: Checks if `isinstance(a, b)`.
        *  `assertNotIsInstance(a, b)`: Checks if `not isinstance(a, b)`.
        *  `assertRaises(exception, callable, *args, **kwargs)`:  Checks if calling `callable` with the given arguments raises the specified `exception`.  This is crucial for testing error handling. The `with` statement ensures the exception is properly caught and handled.
        *   `assertRaisesRegex`: Same as `assertRaises`, but also checks if the exception message matches a regular expression.

*   **Choosing the Right Assertion:** Use the most specific assertion possible.  This makes your tests more readable and provides better error messages.  For example, use `assertIsNone` instead of `assertEqual(x, None)`.

## Module 4: Setup and Teardown

*   **Purpose:**
    *   `setUp()`:  Executed *before* each test method.  Used to create resources or set up a consistent environment for each test.
    *   `tearDown()`: Executed *after* each test method, even if the test fails. Used to clean up resources (e.g., close files, delete temporary data).
    *   `setUpClass()`: Executed *once* before all tests in a class. Class method, uses `@classmethod` decorator.
    *   `tearDownClass()`: Executed *once* after all tests in a class. Class method, uses `@classmethod` decorator.
    *  `setUpModule()`: Function that's called *once* when the module is loaded.
    *  `tearDownModule()`: Function that's called *once* when the module is unloaded.

*   **Example:**

    ```python
    import unittest
    import tempfile
    import os

    class TestFileOperations(unittest.TestCase):

        @classmethod
        def setUpClass(cls):
            print("Setting up the class...")
            # Create a class-level resource if needed.
            cls.global_resource = "This is a shared resource"

        @classmethod
        def tearDownClass(cls):
            print("Tearing down the class...")
            # Clean up the class-level resource.
            cls.global_resource = None  # Or any other cleanup

        def setUp(self):
            print("Setting up the test...")
            # Create a temporary file for each test
            self.temp_file = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False)
            self.file_path = self.temp_file.name

        def tearDown(self):
            print("Tearing down the test...")
            # Close and delete the temporary file
            self.temp_file.close()
            os.remove(self.file_path)

        def test_write_to_file(self):
            with open(self.file_path, 'w') as f:
                f.write("Hello, world!")
            with open(self.file_path, 'r') as f:
                content = f.read()
            self.assertEqual(content, "Hello, world!")

        def test_read_from_file(self):
            # Example where we pre-populate the file in setUp
            with open(self.file_path, 'w') as f:
                f.write("Pre-existing content")
            with open(self.file_path, 'r') as f:
                content = f.read()
            self.assertEqual(content, "Pre-existing content")

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        unittest.main(verbosity=2)

    ```

    *   **Explanation:**
        *   `setUp()` creates a temporary file *before each test*.
        *   `tearDown()` closes and deletes the temporary file *after each test*. This ensures that tests don't interfere with each other and that we clean up after ourselves.
        *   `setUpClass` and `tearDownClass` are used for setup/teardown that only needs to happen once per test class, which can be more efficient.

## Module 5:  Organizing Tests

*   **Test Suites:**
    *   Concept:  A collection of test cases or other test suites.  Useful for grouping related tests.
    *   Example:

        ```python
        import unittest
        # Assume you have TestClass1 and TestClass2 defined in other files.
        from test_module1 import TestClass1
        from test_module2 import TestClass2

        def suite():
            suite = unittest.TestSuite()
            suite.addTest(unittest.makeSuite(TestClass1))  # Add all tests from TestClass1
            suite.addTest(unittest.makeSuite(TestClass2))
            # Or add individual tests:
            # suite.addTest(TestClass1('test_method_name'))
            return suite

        if __name__ == '__main__':
            runner = unittest.TextTestRunner()
            runner.run(suite())

        ```
        * **Explanation:**
            *  `unittest.TestSuite()` creates a test suite.
            *  `suite.addTest()` adds tests to the suite.
            *  `unittest.makeSuite(TestClass)` creates a suite containing all tests in `TestClass`.
            *  `unittest.TextTestRunner` runs the suite and provides text output.

*   **Test Discovery:**
    *   `unittest` can automatically discover and run tests.  This is usually the preferred method.
    *   Command-line: `python -m unittest discover` (finds all files matching `test*.py`)
    *   Customize discovery: `python -m unittest discover -s test_directory -p '*_test.py'` (searches in `test_directory` for files ending in `_test.py`)

*   **Best Practices for Organization:**
    *   **Separate Test Files:** Keep your tests in separate files from your production code. This keeps things clean and organized.
    *   **Mirror Directory Structure:**  Often, the structure of your test directory mirrors the structure of your source code directory.  For example, if you have `my_project/module1/file1.py`, your tests might be in `my_project/tests/module1/test_file1.py`.
    *   **Use Descriptive Names:**  Test file names, class names, and method names should clearly indicate what is being tested.
    *   **`__init__.py` files:** Make sure any directory containing tests has an `__init__.py` file (even if it's empty).  This tells Python that the directory is a package.

## Module 6:  Mocking and Test Doubles

*   **The Problem with Dependencies:**
    *   Sometimes, a unit you want to test depends on other units (e.g., a function that makes a network request or interacts with a database).
    *   Directly testing these dependencies can be problematic:
        *   Slow (network requests, database access).
        *   Unreliable (external services might be down).
        *   Difficult to set up (database connections, specific data).
        *   Violates the "isolated" principle of unit testing.

*   **Test Doubles:**
    *   Concept:  Replacing real dependencies with "fake" objects that you control.
    *   Types of Test Doubles:
        *   **Mocks:**  Objects that record interactions.  You can verify that specific methods were called with expected arguments.
        *   **Stubs:**  Objects that provide pre-programmed responses to method calls.  They don't record interactions.
        *   **Fakes:** Simplified implementations of a dependency (e.g., an in-memory database).
        *   **Spies:**  Like mocks, but they also allow the original method to be called.
        *   **Dummies:** Objects that are passed around but never actually used (e.g., to satisfy a function signature).

*   **`unittest.mock` (or `mock` in Python 2)**
    *   Introduction:  A powerful library for creating mocks and stubs in Python.
    *   Key Classes:
        *   `Mock`:  The basic mock object.
        *   `MagicMock`:  A `Mock` subclass that automatically implements magic methods (like `__str__`, `__len__`).
        *   `patch`:  A decorator or context manager used to replace real objects with mocks.

*   **Mocking Example:**

    ```python
    import unittest
    from unittest.mock import Mock, patch

    # my_module.py (The code to be tested)
    import requests  # We'll mock this

    def get_data_from_api(url):
        """Fetches data from an API."""
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for bad status codes
        return response.json()

    # test_my_module.py (The test file)

    class TestGetDataFromApi(unittest.TestCase):

        @patch('my_module.requests.get')  # Replace requests.get with a mock
        def test_get_data_from_api_success(self, mock_get):
            # Configure the mock to return a specific response
            mock_response = Mock()
            mock_response.json.return_value = {'data': 'Mocked data'}
            mock_response.status_code = 200 #added to fix missing status code
            mock_get.return_value = mock_response
            # Call the function being tested
            data = get_data_from_api('https://example.com/api')

            # Assertions
            mock_get.assert_called_once_with('https://example.com/api')  # Check if get was called
            self.assertEqual(data, {'data': 'Mocked data'})
            mock_response.raise_for_status.assert_not_called() # Check raise_for_status

        @patch('my_module.requests.get')
        def test_get_data_from_api_failure(self, mock_get):
            # Configure the mock to raise an exception
            mock_get.side_effect = requests.exceptions.RequestException("Mocked error")

            # Assert that the exception is raised
            with self.assertRaises(requests.exceptions.RequestException):
                get_data_from_api('https://example.com/api')

            mock_get.assert_called_once_with('https://example.com/api')

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        unittest.main(verbosity=2)
    ```
    * **Explanation:**
        *   `@patch('my_module.requests.get')`:  This decorator replaces the `requests.get` function *within the `my_module` module* with a `Mock` object. The mock is passed as an argument (`mock_get`) to the test method.
        *   `mock_get.return_value`:  We set the return value of the mock.  When `requests.get` is called (which is now actually `mock_get`), it will return our mock response object.
        *   `mock_get.side_effect`: We can make the mock raise an exception, simulate a network error.
        *   `mock_get.assert_called_once_with(...)`: We verify that the mock was called with the expected arguments.
        *   `mock_response.json.return_value`: We configure the `json()` method of our mock response to return a specific dictionary.
        *  The `test_get_data_from_api_failure` test demonstrates how to test for exceptions.

* **`patch` as a context manager:**

    ```python
     class TestGetDataFromApi(unittest.TestCase):
        def test_get_data_from_api_success_context_manager(self):
            with patch('my_module.requests.get') as mock_get:
                mock_response = Mock()
                mock_response.json.return_value = {'data': 'Mocked data'}
                mock_response.status_code = 200
                mock_get.return_value = mock_response

                data = get_data_from_api('https://example.com/api')

                mock_get.assert_called_once_with('https://example.com/api')
                self.assertEqual(data, {'data': 'Mocked data'})
                mock_response.raise_for_status.assert_not_called()  # Check raise_for_status
    ```

    *   Using `patch` as a context manager (`with patch(...) as ...`) is often cleaner, especially for simple mocks.  The patching is automatically undone when the `with` block ends.

## Module 7: Advanced Topics and Best Practices

*   **Test-Driven Development (TDD):**
    *   Process:
        1.  **Red:** Write a failing test *before* writing any production code.
        2.  **Green:** Write the *minimum* amount of code to make the test pass.
        3.  **Refactor:** Clean up and improve the code, while keeping the tests passing.
    *   Benefits:
        *   Ensures 100% test coverage (in theory).
        *   Leads to better code design (because you think about testability from the start).
        *   Provides immediate feedback.
        * Example (simple addition function, following TDD):

            ```python
            # test_tdd_example.py (Start here!)
            import unittest
            # from tdd_example import add  # Uncomment after the first test fails

            class TestAdd(unittest.TestCase):
                def test_add_two_positive_numbers(self):
                    self.assertEqual(add(2, 3), 5)  # This will fail initially

            if __name__ == '__main__':
                unittest.main()

            # --- (Run the test - it fails) ---

            # tdd_example.py (Now write the code)
            def add(x, y):
                return x + y

            # --- (Run the test again - it passes) ---

            # Now you might add more tests (negative numbers, floats, etc.)
            # and refactor the add function if needed, always keeping the tests green.
            ```

*   **Parametrized Tests (using `subTest`)**
    *   Avoid code duplication when testing the same logic with different inputs.
    * Example:

    ```python
    import unittest

    def calculate_discount(price, discount_percentage):
        if not (0 <= discount_percentage <= 100):
            raise ValueError("Discount percentage must be between 0 and 100")
        return price * (1 - discount_percentage / 100)

    class TestCalculateDiscount(unittest.TestCase):
        def test_calculate_discount(self):
            test_cases = [
                (100, 0, 100),  # (price, discount, expected)
                (100, 10, 90),
                (100, 50, 50),
                (100, 100, 0),
                (50, 25, 37.5),
            ]
            for price, discount, expected in test_cases:
                with self.subTest(price=price, discount=discount):
                    self.assertEqual(calculate_discount(price, discount), expected)
        def test_invalid_discount(self):
            with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
                calculate_discount(100,-10)
            with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
                calculate_discount(100,110)


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        unittest.main(verbosity=2)

    ```
    *   **Explanation:**
        *  `subTest`: Creates a sub-test within a test method.  If one sub-test fails, the others still run. The `with self.subTest(...)` block allows you to run the same assertion logic with different inputs. Each iteration of the loop is treated as a separate sub-test.  This makes the test output more informative.

*   **Skipping Tests**
    *   `@unittest.skip(reason)`:  Skips a test unconditionally.
    *   `@unittest.skipIf(condition, reason)`:  Skips a test if the `condition` is true.
    *   `@unittest.skipUnless(condition, reason)`: Skips a test unless the `condition` is true.
    *   `unittest.SkipTest(reason)`:  Raise this exception within a test method to skip it.

    ```python
    import unittest
    import sys

    class TestSkipping(unittest.TestCase):

        @unittest.skip("This test is always skipped")
        def test_always_skipped(self):
            self.fail("This should never be executed")

        @unittest.skipIf(sys.platform.startswith("win"), "Only runs on non-Windows platforms")
        def test_skip_on_windows(self):
            pass  # Test logic for non-Windows platforms

        @unittest.skipUnless(sys.version_info >= (3, 8), "Requires Python 3.8 or higher")
        def test_python_version_dependent(self):
            pass  # Test logic for Python 3.8+

        def test_conditional_skip(self):
            if some_condition:  # Replace with your actual condition
                raise unittest.SkipTest("Skipping because some_condition is true")
            # Test logic that runs if some_condition is false
    ```

*   **Expected Failures**
    *   `@unittest.expectedFailure`:  Marks a test as expected to fail.  If it passes, it's considered an unexpected success. Useful for documenting known bugs that haven't been fixed yet.

    ```python
    import unittest

    class TestExpectedFailure(unittest.TestCase):

        @unittest.expectedFailure
        def test_known_bug(self):
            self.assertEqual(1, 2)  # This test will fail, but it's marked as expected

    ```

* **Fixtures (External Resources):** While `setUp` and `tearDown` are great for managing simple resources, sometimes you need more complex setup or teardown logic, or you need to share resources between test classes. While `unittest` doesn't have a built-in "fixtures" system like pytest, you can achieve similar functionality using class-level setup/teardown and helper functions.  Consider using `pytest` for more advanced fixture management.

* **Code Coverage:** Tools like `coverage.py` can measure which lines of your code are executed by your tests. This helps you identify gaps in your test coverage.  High coverage is a good indicator, but it doesn't guarantee that your tests are *effective* (they might not be testing the right things).
* **Continuous Integration (CI):** Integrate your tests into a CI system (e.g., Jenkins, Travis CI, GitHub Actions).  This automatically runs your tests whenever you push code changes, providing rapid feedback.

# Python Unit Testing Guide with unittest

## 1. Introduction to unittest
The unittest module is inspired by Java's JUnit and provides a rich set of tools for constructing and running tests. It supports:

- Test automation: Running multiple tests automatically
- Setup and teardown: Preparing and cleaning up test environments
- Assertions: Checking if conditions are met
- Test discovery: Automatically finding and running tests

## 2. Basic Structure of a Test Case
A test case is created by subclassing unittest.TestCase. Each test is a method whose name starts with test_.

```python
import unittest

# Function to be tested
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# Test case
class TestMathOperations(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_add(self):
        result = add(2, 3)
        self.assertEqual(result, 5)  # Assertion

# Run the tests
if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

## 3. Key Components of unittest

### a. Assertions
Assertions are used to verify that the code behaves as expected. Common assertions include:

- assertEqual(a, b): Checks if a == b
- assertTrue(x): Checks if x is True
- assertFalse(x): Checks if x is False
- assertRaises(exception, callable, *args, **kwargs): Checks if callable raises exception

```python
class TestAssertions(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_assertions(self):
        self.assertEqual(3 + 4, 7)
        self.assertTrue(10 > 5)
        self.assertFalse(10 < 5)
        with self.assertRaises(ZeroDivisionError):
            x = 1 / 0
```

### b. Setup and Teardown
- setUp(): Runs before each test method. Use it to prepare the test environment
- tearDown(): Runs after each test method. Use it to clean up resources

```python
class TestDatabase(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        # Initialize a database connection
        self.db = Database()
        self.db.connect()

    def tearDown(self):
        # Close the database connection
        self.db.disconnect()

    def test_query(self):
        result = self.db.query("SELECT * FROM users")
        self.assertIsNotNone(result)
```

### c. Test Suites
A test suite is a collection of test cases. You can group related tests together.

```python
def suite():
    suite = unittest.TestSuite()
    suite.addTest(TestMathOperations('test_add'))
    suite.addTest(TestDatabase('test_query'))
    return suite

if __name__ == "__main__":
    runner = unittest.TextTestRunner()
    runner.run(suite())
```

### d. Skipping Tests
You can skip tests using the @unittest.skip decorator.

```python
class TestSkip(unittest.TestCase):
    @unittest.skip("Skipping this test")
    def test_skip(self):
        self.fail("This test should be skipped")

    @unittest.skipIf(1 > 0, "Skipping if condition is True")
    def test_skip_if(self):
        self.fail("This test should be skipped if 1 > 0")
```

## 4. Running Tests
You can run tests in several ways:

From the command line:
```bash
python -m unittest test_module.py
```

Using unittest.main():
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

Using test discovery:
```bash
python -m unittest discover
```

## 5. Advanced Features

### a. Mocking
The unittest.mock module allows you to replace parts of your system under test with mock objects.

```python
from unittest.mock import patch

class TestMocking(unittest.TestCase):
    @patch('math.sqrt')  # Mock the math.sqrt function
    def test_mock(self, mock_sqrt):
        mock_sqrt.return_value = 10
        result = math.sqrt(4)
        self.assertEqual(result, 10)  # Mocked result
```

### b. Parameterized Tests
You can use libraries like parameterized to run the same test with different inputs.

```python
from parameterized import parameterized

class TestParameterized(unittest.TestCase):
    @parameterized.expand([
        (1, 2, 3),
        (4, 5, 9),
        (0, 0, 0),
    ])
    def test_add(self, a, b, expected):
        self.assertEqual(add(a, b), expected)
```

## 6. Best Practices

- Write small, focused tests: Each test should verify one specific behavior
- Use descriptive test names: Method names like test_add_positive_numbers are more informative
- Avoid dependencies between tests: Tests should be independent and run in any order
- Use mocks for external dependencies: Isolate your code from external systems like databases or APIs
- Run tests frequently: Integrate tests into your development workflow

## 7. Example: Comprehensive Test Case
Here's a complete example that combines all the concepts:

```python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch

# Function to be tested
def divide(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
    return a / b

# Test case
class TestMathOperations(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        print("Setting up...")

    def tearDown(self):
        print("Tearing down...")

    def test_divide(self):
        self.assertEqual(divide(10, 2), 5)
        self.assertEqual(divide(9, 3), 3)

    def test_divide_by_zero(self):
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            divide(10, 0)

    @patch('math.pow', return_value=16)
    def test_mock_pow(self, mock_pow):
        self.assertEqual(math.pow(2, 4), 16)  # Mocked result

    @unittest.skip("Skipping this test")
    def test_skip(self):
        self.fail("This test should be skipped")

# Run the tests
if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

## 8. Conclusion
The unittest framework is a powerful tool for ensuring the correctness of your Python code. By writing comprehensive tests, you can catch bugs early, improve code quality, and make your codebase more maintainable. Use the concepts and examples above to build robust test suites for your projects.


############################
# Comprehensive Guide to Unit Testing in Python with unittest

Unit testing is a critical practice in software development that ensures individual components of a program work as expected. Python provides the built-in unittest module, which is a powerful tool for writing and running tests.

## 1. Introduction to Unit Testing

Unit testing involves testing the smallest testable parts (units) of an application in isolation. In Python, the unittest module provides a robust framework for writing, organizing, and running tests.

**Why Unit Testing?**
- Ensures code correctness
- Helps in debugging and catching regressions
- Facilitates refactoring
- Supports Test-Driven Development (TDD)

## 2. Basics of unittest in Python

### Writing a Simple Test Case
A test case is created by subclassing unittest.TestCase and defining methods that start with test_.

```python
import unittest

# Function to be tested
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

# Creating a test case
class TestMathOperations(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_add(self):
        self.assertEqual(add(2, 3), 5)  # Test case 1
        self.assertEqual(add(-1, 1), 0)  # Test case 2

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

**Explanation**
- unittest.TestCase: Inherits from this class to create test cases.
- assertEqual(a, b): Checks if a == b, otherwise fails the test.
- unittest.main(): Runs all test cases.

## 3. Common Assertions in unittest

unittest provides various assertion methods:

| Assertion Method | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| assertEqual(a, b) | Checks if a == b |
| assertNotEqual(a, b) | Checks if a != b |
| assertTrue(x) | Checks if x is True |
| assertFalse(x) | Checks if x is False |
| assertIs(a, b) | Checks if a is b |
| assertIsNot(a, b) | Checks if a is not b |
| assertIsNone(x) | Checks if x is None |
| assertIsNotNone(x) | Checks if x is not None |
| assertRaises(Exception, func, *args) | Checks if func(*args) raises Exception |

### Example: Testing for Exceptions

```python
def divide(x, y):
    if y == 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
    return x / y

class TestMathOperations(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_divide(self):
        self.assertRaises(ValueError, divide, 4, 0)
```

## 4. Running Tests

### Running Tests from the Command Line
Save the test script (e.g., test_math.py) and run:

```bash
python -m unittest test_math.py
```

or discover all tests in a directory:

```bash
python -m unittest discover
```

## 5. Setup and Teardown Methods

- setUp(): Runs before each test case (e.g., initializing resources).
- tearDown(): Runs after each test case (e.g., cleaning up).

### Example: Using setUp and tearDown

```python
class TestExample(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.data = [1, 2, 3]

    def tearDown(self):
        self.data = None

    def test_length(self):
        self.assertEqual(len(self.data), 3)
```

## 6. Mocking with unittest.mock

Mocking is useful for testing code that depends on external systems.

### Example: Using unittest.mock

```python
from unittest.mock import MagicMock

class Database:
    def fetch_data(self):
        return "Real Data"

class TestDatabase(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_fetch_data(self):
        db = Database()
        db.fetch_data = MagicMock(return_value="Mocked Data")
        self.assertEqual(db.fetch_data(), "Mocked Data")
```

## 7. Advanced Testing Techniques

### Parameterized Tests
Using subTest() to run multiple test cases efficiently.

```python
class TestMath(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_add(self):
        test_cases = [(2, 3, 5), (-1, 1, 0), (0, 0, 0)]
        for x, y, expected in test_cases:
            with self.subTest(x=x, y=y, expected=expected):
                self.assertEqual(add(x, y), expected)
```

### Skipping Tests

```python
class TestExample(unittest.TestCase):
    @unittest.skip("Skipping this test")
    def test_skipped(self):
        self.fail("This should not run")

    @unittest.expectedFailure
    def test_expected_failure(self):
        self.assertEqual(1, 0)
```

## 8. Test Coverage with coverage.py

To measure test coverage, install coverage:

```bash
pip install coverage
```

Run tests with coverage:

```bash
coverage run -m unittest discover
coverage report -m
```

## 9. Structuring Unit Tests in a Project

A common structure:

```
project/
│── mymodule/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── math_utils.py
│── tests/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── test_math_utils.py
```

Run all tests:

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```

## 10. Best Practices for Writing Unit Tests

- Keep tests isolated and independent.
- Use descriptive test method names.
- Cover edge cases and invalid inputs.
- Run tests frequently and integrate with CI/CD pipelines.
- Maintain clear test documentation.

# Advanced unittest in Python: A Guide for Experts

Unit testing is a crucial aspect of software development that ensures code reliability and maintainability. This guide covers advanced testing techniques, including metaprogramming for dynamic test generation, advanced mocking strategies, integration with CI/CD, and performance testing.

## 1. Advanced Assertions and Custom Test Cases

Python's unittest supports powerful assertions beyond the basics.

### Example: Custom Assertion Methods

```python
import unittest

class CustomTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
    def assertListAlmostEqual(self, list1, list2, places=7):
        """Custom assertion to compare lists of floats."""
        self.assertEqual(len(list1), len(list2), "Lists are not the same length")
        for a, b in zip(list1, list2):
            self.assertAlmostEqual(a, b, places)

class TestMathOperations(CustomTestCase):
    def test_list_approximation(self):
        result = [0.12345678, 0.23456789, 0.34567890]
        expected = [0.12345679, 0.23456788, 0.34567891]
        self.assertListAlmostEqual(result, expected, places=7)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

**Key Benefit**: Custom assertions improve readability and code reusability.

## 2. Dynamic Test Generation

Instead of writing repetitive tests, you can generate them dynamically using `type()`.

### Example: Generating Tests Dynamically

```python
def dynamic_test_generator(value, expected):
    def test(self):
        self.assertEqual(value + 2, expected)
    return test

class TestDynamic(unittest.TestCase):
    pass

# Generate multiple test cases dynamically
test_cases = [(2, 4), (5, 7), (-1, 1)]
for index, (val, exp) in enumerate(test_cases):
    setattr(TestDynamic, f"test_dynamic_case_{index}", dynamic_test_generator(val, exp))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

**Key Benefit**: Automates repetitive test creation and scales well.

## 3. Using Fixtures (setUpClass, tearDownClass, setUpModule)

Instead of initializing resources in each test, we can use class-level or module-level setup methods.

### Example: Efficient Resource Setup

```python
import unittest

class TestDatabase(unittest.TestCase):
    @classmethod
    def setUpClass(cls):
        print("\n[Setup] Connecting to database...")
        cls.db = {"user": "admin", "password": "secret"}  # Simulated DB

    @classmethod
    def tearDownClass(cls):
        print("\n[TearDown] Closing database connection...")
        cls.db = None

    def test_db_connection(self):
        self.assertIn("user", self.db)
        self.assertEqual(self.db["user"], "admin")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

**Key Benefit**: Optimizes resource management by setting up expensive objects only once.

## 4. Advanced Mocking with patch.object and side_effect

Mocking external dependencies is crucial for isolated tests.

### Example: Mocking an API Call

```python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch

class APIClient:
    def fetch_data(self):
        # Simulating an API call
        raise NotImplementedError("This should be mocked!")

class TestAPIClient(unittest.TestCase):
    @patch.object(APIClient, "fetch_data", return_value={"status": "success", "data": [1, 2, 3]})
    def test_fetch_data(self, mock_fetch):
        client = APIClient()
        response = client.fetch_data()
        self.assertEqual(response["status"], "success")
        self.assertEqual(response["data"], [1, 2, 3])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

**Key Benefit**: `patch.object()` is ideal for replacing instance methods.

## 5. Parallel Test Execution for Performance

Running tests in parallel can significantly improve speed.

### Example: Using concurrent.futures

```python
import unittest
import concurrent.futures

def run_test(test_case):
    suite = unittest.TestLoader().loadTestsFromTestCase(test_case)
    unittest.TextTestRunner().run(suite)

class TestA(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_slow_1(self):
        self.assertEqual(1 + 1, 2)

class TestB(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_slow_2(self):
        self.assertTrue(isinstance("hello", str))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_cases = [TestA, TestB]
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        executor.map(run_test, test_cases)
```

**Key Benefit**: Boosts execution speed by running tests concurrently.

## 6. Integration with CI/CD

Running tests automatically in CI/CD ensures high code quality.

### Example: GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
name: Run Python Unittests

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: "3.9"
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Run tests
        run: python -m unittest discover tests
```

**Key Benefit**: Automates test execution on every push or pull request.

## 7. Measuring Test Execution Time

Tracking slow tests helps optimize performance.

### Example: Tracking Test Durations

```python
import unittest
import time

class TestPerformance(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_slow_function(self):
        start = time.time()
        time.sleep(1)  # Simulate slow function
        duration = time.time() - start
        self.assertLess(duration, 1.5, "Test took too long!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

**Key Benefit**: Identifies performance bottlenecks.

## 8. Fuzz Testing with hypothesis

Instead of writing specific test cases, generate randomized test inputs.

### Example: Using hypothesis for Property-Based Testing

```python
import unittest
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st

class TestFuzz(unittest.TestCase):
    @given(st.integers(), st.integers())
    def test_fuzz_addition(self, a, b):
        self.assertEqual(a + b, b + a)  # Commutative property

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

**Key Benefit**: Catches edge cases that manual testing might miss.

## 9. Handling Flaky Tests

Sometimes tests fail unpredictably due to timing issues.

### Example: Retrying Flaky Tests

```python
import unittest
from flaky import flaky

@flaky(max_runs=3, min_passes=1)
class TestFlaky(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_may_fail(self):
        import random
        self.assertTrue(random.choice([True, False]))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

**Key Benefit**: Useful when testing APIs, time-sensitive features, or race conditions.

## Summary

- Custom assertions
- Dynamic test generation
- Advanced mocking techniques
- Parallel test execution
- CI/CD integration
- Performance monitoring
- Fuzz testing
- Flaky test handling

# Professional Guide to Python Unit Testing

## Introduction to Unit Testing in Python
Unit testing is a fundamental practice in software development that ensures individual components of your code work as intended. Python's `unittest` framework provides a robust foundation for implementing these tests effectively.

## Core Testing Components

### Test Structure and Organization
Unit tests in Python follow a structured approach based on object-oriented principles:
- Tests are encapsulated in classes that inherit from `unittest.TestCase`
- Individual test methods are prefixed with `test_` to enable automatic test discovery
- Test classes provide a controlled environment for testing related functionality
- Test methods should be focused, testing one specific aspect of functionality

### Essential Assertions
The `unittest` framework provides a comprehensive set of assertion methods to validate your code's behavior:

```python
# Core assertions and their use cases
self.assertEqual(a, b)      # Verifies that a equals b
self.assertTrue(x)         # Confirms that x evaluates to True
self.assertFalse(x)       # Confirms that x evaluates to False
self.assertRaises(Error)   # Verifies that specific exceptions are raised
self.assertIn(a, b)       # Checks if a is contained within b
self.assertIsNone(x)      # Validates that x is None
self.assertIsInstance(a, type)  # Confirms a is an instance of type
```

## Advanced Testing Concepts

### Test Fixtures: Creating Stable Test Environments
Test fixtures provide a consistent environment for your tests to run reliably. The fixture lifecycle includes:

1. **Setup Phase**
   - `setUp()`: Executes before each individual test method
   - `setUpClass()`: Runs once before all tests in the class

2. **Teardown Phase**
   - `tearDown()`: Executes after each individual test method
   - `tearDownClass()`: Runs once after all tests in the class

Example implementation:
```python
class DatabaseTest(unittest.TestCase):
    @classmethod
    def setUpClass(cls):
        cls.db = DatabaseConnection()
        cls.db.create_schema()
    
    def setUp(self):
        self.transaction = self.db.begin_transaction()
    
    def tearDown(self):
        self.transaction.rollback()
    
    @classmethod
    def tearDownClass(cls):
        cls.db.close()
```

### Mocking: Isolating System Dependencies
Mocking is essential for creating isolated unit tests by replacing real system dependencies with controlled substitutes:

```python
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch

class UserServiceTest(unittest.TestCase):
    @patch('module.DatabaseConnection')
    def test_get_user(self, mock_db):
        # Configure the mock
        mock_db.return_value.query.return_value = {'id': 1, 'name': 'John'}
        
        # Test the service
        service = UserService(mock_db)
        user = service.get_user(1)
        
        # Verify the results
        self.assertEqual(user.name, 'John')
        mock_db.return_value.query.assert_called_once_with(1)
```

### Parameterized Testing: Efficient Test Case Management
Parameterized testing allows you to test multiple scenarios without duplicating code:

```python
class CalculatorTest(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_addition(self):
        test_cases = [
            (0, 0, 0),
            (1, 1, 2),
            (-1, 1, 0),
            (1000, 2000, 3000)
        ]
        
        for x, y, expected in test_cases:
            with self.subTest(f"{x} + {y} = {expected}"):
                result = Calculator.add(x, y)
                self.assertEqual(result, expected)
```

## Best Practices and Advanced Features

### Test Organization
- Group related tests in the same test class
- Use descriptive test method names that indicate the scenario being tested
- Maintain a clear separation between test code and production code
- Follow a consistent naming convention for test files (e.g., `test_*.py`)

### Asynchronous Testing
For testing asynchronous code, utilize the `asyncio` testing utilities:

```python
class AsyncServiceTest(unittest.TestCase):
    async def test_async_operation(self):
        result = await async_function()
        self.assertEqual(result, expected_value)
```

### Coverage Analysis
Implement coverage reporting to ensure comprehensive test coverage:

```bash
# Running coverage analysis
coverage run -m unittest discover
coverage report
coverage html  # Generates detailed HTML report
```

### Conditional Test Execution
Use skip decorators to handle environment-specific tests:

```python
@unittest.skipIf(sys.platform == 'win32', "Test not supported on Windows")
def test_unix_specific_feature(self):
    # Test implementation
```

## Conclusion
Effective unit testing is crucial for maintaining code quality and preventing regressions. By following these professional testing practices and utilizing Python's testing frameworks effectively, you can create a robust test suite that ensures your code's reliability and maintainability.


############################
## A Comprehensive Deep Dive

### 1. Basic Test Structure

Tests are organized into classes that inherit from unittest.TestCase
Each test method starts with test_
setUp() and tearDown() methods handle test fixtures
Assertions verify expected outcomes


### 2. Common Assertions

assertEqual(a, b): Verify equality
assertTrue(x): Verify condition is True
assertFalse(x): Verify condition is False
assertRaises(Exception): Verify exception handling
assertIn(a, b): Verify membership
assertIsNone(x): Verify None value
assertIsInstance(a, type): Verify type


### 3. Test Fixtures
"Test Stabilizers" or "Test Fixings." It captures the idea of setting up a stable environment for testing.

setUp(): Runs before each test
tearDown(): Runs after each test
setUpClass(): Runs once before all tests in class
tearDownClass(): Runs once after all tests in class

Example (Conceptual):
Imagine you're testing a database connection.

setUp(): Would establish a connection before each individual test.
tearDown(): Would close that connection after each individual test.
setUpClass(): Might create the database table structure once before all tests start.
tearDownClass(): Might drop that table structure once after all tests are finished.

### 4. Mocking
"Substitution" or "Replacement." It captures the idea of replacing real dependencies with simulated ones.

Mocking is crucial in testing because it isolates the unit under test.  Imagine you're testing a function that relies on a database.  You don't want your tests to actually interact with a real database (which can be slow, unreliable, and might have side effects).  Instead, you use a mock object to simulate the database.  This mock object will:

Provide pre-defined return values: When your function calls the mock database object, it will return the values you've configured it to return.
Record how it was called: The mock object keeps track of which methods were called and with what arguments. This allows you to verify that your function is interacting with the database correctly.

Use unittest.mock for creating mock objects
@patch decorator for mocking dependencies
Mock return values and side effects
Track method calls and arguments

Example (Conceptual):
Let's say you have a function get_user_data(user_id) that fetches user data from a database.

Without Mocking: Your test would need a real database.
With Mocking: You create a mock database object. You tell the mock object that if get_user_data(123) is called, it should return a dictionary like {"name": "John", "age": 30}. Your test then calls get_user_data(123). The function interacts with the mock database, gets the pre-defined return value, and your test can then assert that the function is working as expected. You can also check if get_user_data called the correct methods on the mock database object.

### 5. Parameterized Testing
Parameterized testing is a technique to run the same test logic with different input values.  Instead of writing multiple nearly identical test functions, you write one test function that accepts parameters.  This significantly reduces code duplication and improves maintainability.

Use subTest for running multiple test cases
Maintain clean test organization
Reduce code duplication
Better error reporting

subTest (within the unittest framework) is a context manager that allows you to run variations of a test within the same test method.  Each variation can have its own set of input parameters.  Even if one subTest fails, the other variations will still run, and you'll get detailed error messages for each.

Example (Conceptual):

Let's say you want to test a function add(x, y) that adds two numbers.  Instead of writing separate tests for add(1, 2), add(5, 10), add(-1, 1), etc., you can use parameterized testing:

import unittest

class TestAdd(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_add(self):
        test_cases = [
            (1, 2, 3),  # x, y, expected_result
            (5, 10, 15),
            (-1, 1, 0),
        ]
        for x, y, expected in test_cases:
            with self.subTest(x=x, y=y):  # subTest for each variation
                result = add(x, y)
                self.assertEqual(result, expected)

### 6. Advanced Features

Async Testing capabilities:  When dealing with asynchronous code (using async and await in Python), you need special tools to test it effectively.  Standard test runners might not handle asynchronous operations correctly.  Advanced testing frameworks provide ways to properly run and assert on the results of asynchronous code.

Skip Decorators for conditional testing:  The @unittest.skip decorator (and related decorators like @unittest.skipIf and @unittest.skipUnless) allow you to mark tests as skipped.  This is useful for situations where a test is not relevant in a certain environment or if a dependency is missing.  It prevents tests from failing unnecessarily and keeps your test results clean.

Test Discovery and Organization:  As your project grows, organizing your tests becomes crucial.  Test discovery features automatically find and run tests based on patterns (e.g., all files starting with test_ or residing in a tests directory).  This makes it easy to run your entire test suite with a single command.

Coverage Reporting:  Code coverage is an important metric.  It tells you what percentage of your codebase is exercised by your tests.  High coverage doesn't guarantee bug-free code, but it significantly increases your confidence in its correctness.  Coverage reports highlight lines or branches of code that are not covered by tests, guiding you to write more comprehensive tests.

# Advanced Python Unit Testing
## A Comprehensive Deep Dive

### 1. Mock Objects and Patch Decorators
#### Understanding Advanced Mocking
- **Context Managers vs Decorators**
  ```python
  # Using context manager
  with patch('module.ClassName') as mock_class:
      instance = mock_class.return_value
      instance.method.return_value = 'mocked'
      
  # Using decorator
  @patch('module.ClassName')
  def test_function(self, mock_class):
      instance = mock_class.return_value
      instance.method.return_value = 'mocked'
  ```

- **Mock Side Effects**
  ```python
  def side_effect_func(arg):
      if arg < 0:
          raise ValueError("Negative value")
      return arg * 2

  mock_obj.method.side_effect = side_effect_func
  ```

### 2. Test Fixtures and Resource Management
#### Advanced Setup and Teardown
```python
class AdvancedTests(unittest.TestCase):
    @classmethod
    def setUpClass(cls):
        cls.shared_resource = expensive_setup()
        
    def setUp(self):
        self.temp_dir = create_temp_directory()
        self.addCleanup(self.cleanup_temp_dir)
        
    def cleanup_temp_dir(self):
        shutil.rmtree(self.temp_dir)
```

### 3. Parameterized Testing Techniques
#### Using Data Providers
```python
class TestWithParameters(unittest.TestCase):
    @parameterized.expand([
        ("valid_case", "input1", True),
        ("edge_case", "", False),
        ("error_case", None, False)
    ])
    def test_validation(self, name, input_value, expected):
        result = validate_input(input_value)
        self.assertEqual(result, expected)
```

### 4. Testing Asynchronous Code
#### Handling Async Operations
```python
class AsyncTests(unittest.TestCase):
    async def async_setup(self):
        self.client = await create_async_client()
        
    async def test_async_operation(self):
        await self.async_setup()
        result = await self.client.fetch_data()
        self.assertIsNotNone(result)
        
    def test_async_wrapper(self):
        asyncio.run(self.test_async_operation())
```

### 5. Custom Assertions and Test Helpers
#### Building Test Infrastructure
```python
class CustomAssertions(unittest.TestCase):
    def assertDictContainsSubset(self, expected, actual):
        """Assert that actual dict contains all items from expected dict"""
        for key, value in expected.items():
            self.assertIn(key, actual)
            self.assertEqual(actual[key], value)
            
    def assertValidResponse(self, response):
        """Custom assertion for API responses"""
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        self.assertIn('data', response.json())
```

### 6. Test Coverage and Quality Metrics
#### Advanced Coverage Techniques
```python
# Coverage configuration (.coveragerc)
[run]
branch = True
source = your_package

[report]
exclude_lines =
    pragma: no cover
    def __repr__
    raise NotImplementedError
```

### 7. Integration with CI/CD
#### GitHub Actions Example
```yaml
name: Python Tests
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.x'
      - name: Run Tests
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          python -m pytest --cov
```

### 8. Testing Design Patterns
#### Test Doubles Pattern
```python
class TestDouble:
    def __init__(self, test_case):
        self.test_case = test_case
        self.calls = []
        
    def record_call(self, *args, **kwargs):
        self.calls.append((args, kwargs))
        
    def verify_calls(self, expected_calls):
        self.test_case.assertEqual(
            self.calls,
            expected_calls
        )
```

### 9. Performance Testing
#### Timing Decorators
```python
def time_test(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end = time.time()
        print(f"{func.__name__} took {end - start:.2f} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper
```

### 10. Property-Based Testing
#### Using Hypothesis
```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st

class PropertyTests(unittest.TestCase):
    @given(st.lists(st.integers()))
    def test_sort_idempotent(self, lst):
        """Test that sorting twice gives same result as sorting once"""
        once = sorted(lst)
        twice = sorted(sorted(lst))
        self.assertEqual(once, twice)
```
